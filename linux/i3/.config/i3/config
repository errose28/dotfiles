# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
# is used in the bar {} block below.
# setting size to 0 disables the text in all modes, but still leaves a space above in stacked or tabbed mode.
# Use the font size to adjust the size of the title bar.
# font color can be set to transparent so you don't see the text.
font pango:System San Francisco Display 1

# This font is widely installed, provides lots of unicode glyphs, right-to-left
# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).
#font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 8

# Before i3 v4.8, we used to recommend this one as the default:
# font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, its unicode glyph coverage is limited, the old
# X core fonts rendering does not support right-to-left and this being a bitmap
# font, it doesn’t scale on retina/hidpi displays.
